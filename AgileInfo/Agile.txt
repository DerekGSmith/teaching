Agile is a guided method for software development

Software Development before Agile consisted of a very one track method  | Plan -> Code -> Test -> Deploy -> Maintain    (PDF 3 Page 4)
The issue with this is that plans need to change. Deadlines need to be moved, features need to be added or changed.     

Agile deals with this by having short intervals of time where the entire process is done.                               (PDF 3 Page 7)
Each interval of time has several teams working on different features. 
Scrum Masters are members of each team that will handle impediments and communicate between teams
