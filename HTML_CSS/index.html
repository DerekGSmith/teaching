    Look at this. This is a body.

      HTML consists of containers like p, div, etc. These elements require an
      opening <> and a closing <> both will contain the container type but the
      closing will include a /
    </p>
    <p id="cssPara">
      CSS will edit these containers by id, class, or container type which is
      specific to a specific container. Class can be assigned to several
      containers. Editing an entire container is rare, typically you will edit a
      class and a container at the same time < container >.< class >{cssCode}.
      If not specifically changed children containers will inherit parent
      styles.

      HTML and CSS in general are things that you will not remember unless you
      end up doing this often. The concepts are very simple and you will just
      have to google when you don't know something. Free courses are available
      at several sites if you were interested in truly learning this in depth.
