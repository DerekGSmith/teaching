Important Terms

Creating a Class
    Classes are objects consisting of a name, access specifiers,
    and methods and members that fall under access specifiers.

    Access Specifiers:
        protected: Same as private but classes that inherit the class can access
        private: Only accessible inside of the class
        public: Accessible anywhere

    Methods:
        Getters - Getters will get private variables.
        Setters - Setters will set private variables.
        Other functions

    Members:
        Look at code for examples.

Inheritance
    Inheritance is when one class 'inherits' from another
    A class that is inherited from is called a parent
    A class that inherits a class is called a child or a derived class
    parent
      |
     child

    *very simple concept but struggle often comes from knowing
    *what an inherited class has access to
    Polymorphism
        This can be a difficult concept to understand
        Polymorphism is when multiple classes have the same kind of function but
        different ways of doing it.
